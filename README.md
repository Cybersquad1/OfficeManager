## Usability note

Due to reporting requirements applicable to TI Georgia, the development of this project has been stopped.
Its use makes sense in an environment where digital document approval is considered a valid path for reporting workflow. 

## Office Manager

The application close follows the work flow of work time reporting currently used at Transparency International Georgia.
It allows to:
- request a leave 
- submit the monthly time sheet
- approve a leave or a time sheet (by a designated supervisor)
- allows to configure salary sources and monthly percentage assignments to employees
- lets office managers generate bulk reports of all the documents handled in the system ( time sheets, leave requests, salary assignments)
