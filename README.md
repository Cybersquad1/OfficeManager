## Office Manager

The application close follows the work flow of work time reporting currently used at Transparency International Georgia.
It allows to:
- request a leave 
- submit the monthly time sheet
- approve a leave or a time sheet (by a designated supervisor)
- allows to configure salary sources and monthly percentage assignments to employees
- lets office managers generate bulk reports of all the documents handled in the system ( time sheets, leave requests, salary assignments)
